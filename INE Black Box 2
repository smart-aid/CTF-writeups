While scanning the whole network with nmap i found  five hosts are up.

The i look around for *.81 because it's my lucky number.(Kidding)
#172.16.64.81
"

I then look around the webpage running on port 80. It's just the default apache page and obviously it's a dead end.

Then I tried some directory brute forcing using gobuster.
Then,I found Two interesting directories while brute forcing they are: /webapp and /img
/webapp is  a simple login page.
then i thought the login page was dead end if i have no credentials to login.

And then I visited /img which gives me other subdirectories.I looked around all of them but you don’t need to do this.
In /img/custom….. I found a backup file:users.bak where credentials are stored and obviously it’s not right for the system but for us it’s interesting(maybe).

#Found credentials
#john1:password123
#peter:youdonotguessthatone5


Then i tried to login with john1 which took me to another dead end(Not really)  ‘500.php’ 

Then I decided to see why it’s giving me Lol(500.php with nothing). So I fired my best Burp to investigate.


Then i found a big LOLl response:

#Mysql password in response:
HTTP/1.1 302 Found

X-DB-Key: x41x41x412019!
X-DB-User: root
X-DB-name: mysql
Location: 500.php
Content-Length: 0
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

Obviously like a lame man I tried to login with the default port and it gave me a big Lol. Then I looked back at my network enumeration and I noticed I haven't scanned full ports yet.

The output then made  me remember the line “Think outside the box” ( Haha Trying to motivate nobody).

The mysql was running on port 13306( It's another lucky number.)

And the flag is as:

MySQL [cmsbase]> select * from flag;
+----+------------------------------+
| id | content                      |
+----+------------------------------+
|  1 | Congratulations, you got it! |
+----+------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.459 sec)


Conclusion: Enjoy! with my grammar mistcakes.
